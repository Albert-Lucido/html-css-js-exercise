1. Create the Basic Structure (HTML):
- Create a webpage with a Navigation Bar using Bootstrap.
- Add a Portfolio Section where students will showcase 3 projects. Each project will have an image, title, description, and a button that opens a modal which contains more details regarding the project (Each project must have separate modal information).
- Add a Contact Form using Bootstrap form components.

2. Style the Page (CSS & Bootstrap):
- Use Bootstrap classes for layout and design (e.g., grid system, buttons, forms, etc.).
- Add custom CSS to enhance the look (e.g., hover effects, spacing adjustments).

3. Add Interactivity (JavaScript):
- Add a JavaScript function to display an alert when the contact form is submitted.
- Add a feature where clicking on a project title changes the background color of the portfolio section.
